## Install and activate the Cloudflare WordPress plugin

1. Navigate and log into your WordPress account.
1. Select **Plugins** > **Add new**.

<Aside type="warning">

We recommend turning off plugins such as WP Rocket Cache Plugin, W3 Total Cache, or similar plugins when first setting up APO. After confirming APO is working, we recommend testing whether turning on the plugins listed above improves results or causes unexpected behavior. In many cases, using APO along with other caching plugins can cause unexpected results.
